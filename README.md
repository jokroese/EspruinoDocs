# Bangle.js Documentation (Based on EspruinoDocs)

This repository is a filtered version of the main [EspruinoDocs repository](https://github.com/espruino/EspruinoDocs), focused on documentation of Bangle.js. The goal is to provide the basis for a documentation site specific to Bangle.js.

It removes content from the original repository unless it is directly related to Bangle.js. It also removes the build scripts as the focus is on being an information repository rather than building a site from it.

For the complete Espruino documentation, please visit [espruino.com](http://espruino.com).
